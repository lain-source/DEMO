Physics is an experimental science which involves the observing and measuring of a various phenomenon of nature. It is important that measurements be accurately taken and recorded. These measurements are then used o make connections between the measured phenomena is called a theory. The theory must then be tested experimentally so that it may either be verified or distorted. A physical quantity refers to a quantitative description of the physical phenomena. A physical quantity may be defined by a) A procedure for measuring (eg. distance and time) b) A procedure for calculating (eg. speed v = !\"#$%&'($\")( ) Most physical quantities consist of a product of a numerical magnitude and a unit. Base Quantities and Base Units There are seven base quantities and seven corresponding base units outlined by system\u00e9 International (S.I). Base Quantity Base Unit Mass, m Kilogram (kg) Length, l Metre (m) Time, t Second (s) Temperature, T Kelvin (K) Electric current, I Ampere (A) Amount of substance, n Mole (mol) Luminous intensity, Iv Candele (cd) The Mole Is the amount of substance which contains as many elementary units (atoms/ ions/molecules) as there are atoms in 0.012kg of carbon \u2013 12. The number of elementary units per mole is called the Avogadro constant , NA. it is the same for all the substances. NA = 6.02 \u00d7 1023 mol-^1 Derived Quantity and Derived Units All other quantities are called derived quantities. There are obtained in accordance with a defined equation for the quantity which may involve a) One or more base quantities b) Base quantities and derived quantities c) Derived quantities The corresponding derived units are obtained by the same mathematical operation used to obtain the derived quantity.

Example: Mass and Speed. Vector quantities are those which are specified by both magnitude and direction. Example: Displacement, Velocity, Momentum, Force, Impulse. Addition of Scalars and Vectors Scalars are added by simply finding their arithmetic sum. When adding vectors both magnitude and direction must be considered. Example: Parallel Vectors Resultant, F R = 16 + 12 = 28 N 12N 16N ve + ve Antiparallel Vectors Resultant, F R = 16 + (-12) = 4N The resultant of vectors can also be found using: a) Parallelogram of Vectors Vectors A and B are drawn from the same origin. A straight line is drawn parallel to A and another parallel to B to form a parallelogram. The resultant A and B is represented by the diagonal which passes through the origin. b) Triangle of Vectors Vectors A and B are drawn so that the head of A touches the tail of B. the triangle is completed by drawing the tail of A to the head of B. this represents the resultant of A + B.

These vectors are called components or resolves parts of the vector, F. there is an infinite number of pairs or vectors which can give the resultant, F. however, it is often most convenient to resolve the vectors into mutually perpendicular components. 12N (^) 12N 16N 1200 FR (^600) \u019f 1500 FR 12N 16N 12N 16N (^150 ) FR The horizontal component adjacent to the angle \u019f, its given by cos \u019f = \ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc99 \u00e0 Fx = F cos \u019f The vertical component opposite to the angle \u019f is given by Sin \u019f = \ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc6d^ \u00e0 Fy = F sin \u019f Resultant, F = C\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc66^6 +\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc65^6 = C(\ud835\udc39sin\u019f)^6 +(\ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60)^6 = \u221a\ud835\udc39^6 = F Therefore sin^2 \u019f + cos^2 \u019f = 1 Example: Object on rough incline If the object is in equilibrium, then the resultant force of any two multiply perpendicular directions is zero.

A random error is said to have occurred. These result in a scatter of readings about a mean value and have an equal chance of being positive or negative. Random errors may be caused by a) Inability of the observer to repeat a procedure exactly. Example 1: Variation in reaction time in starting and stopping a stopwatch. Example 2: Interpretation of the actually position of the pointer on the scale. b) Sensitivity of the measuring instrument Example 1: The mechanics of the moving coil meter may cause the pointer to settle in different positions even though the same value is being measured. c) A particular measurement not being reproducible. Example 1: When measuring how temperature falls with time for a particular substance, a value missed cannot be retrieved even though the experiment is repeated. Random errors may be revealed by repeating observations of a particular quantity. If an average is then calculated for a measurement, then the random error may be reduced. Systematic Error A systematic error changes all measurements of a particular quantity equally. Systematic errors result in all the readings taken being faulty in one direction. Systematic errors may be caused by a) An instrument having a zero error Example: A disconnected ammeter which reads 0.2 A will result in all measurements being 0.2 A too large. Example 2: A micrometer screw gauge which is not at zero when it is fully closed. Incorrect calibration of an instrument. Example: A liquid in glass thermometer which does not have 100 equal divisions between 0 and 100. The observer persistently carrying out the wrong reaction. Example: Systematic errors may be eliminated or corrected by: a) Varying all conditions of the experiment Example: Using a different meter b) Suitable mathematical treatment of the observation Example: Adding\\subtracting the zero error. Precision and Accuracy An accurate experiment is one in which the systematic error is relatively small. A precise experiment is one in which the random error is relatively small . Measure value is close to the actual value \u00e0 small s accurate. Large scatter of values \u00e0 large random error and hence is not precise. Measured value is far from actual value \u00e0 large systematic error and hence the experiment is not accurate Small scatter of values \u00e0 small random error and hence it is precise. systematic error and hence the experiment Uncertainties Suppose a reading, x is obtained of a quality whose true value is x, then x = x \u00b1 e e is called the absolute uncertainty in the measurement.

Applied Forces- pushing/ pulling force exerted by one object or another. ii. Frictional Forces - the force which tends to oppose the relative motion between objects or surfaces. iii. Tension Force- force acting in a string or a wire or a spring which is held tout. iv. Normal Force- is a force exerted on a object which is resting on a surface or a fixed support are normal to the surface. b) Non- Contact Forces are produced by the interaction of fields or fields of force. i. Electric Forces- are produced by the interaction of two or more electric fields. Example: Between two points charges. *Maybe one of attraction or repulsion. ii. Magnetic Forces- which is produced by the interaction of the 2 or more magnetic fields. Example: Between 2 permanent magnetics, Between 2 permanent magnets and one current carrying conductor, Between 2 current carrying conductors. *Forces maybe of attraction and repulsion. iii. Nuclear Force- very strong forces of attraction which holds the particles of the nucleus together. iv. Gravitational Forces- are produced by the interaction of gravitational fields around masses and are very weak unless at least one of the objects has a very large mass. Example: The earth The gravitational force exerted by the earth an object is called the weight of the object. W = mg m = mass of object (kg) g \u2013 gravitational strength (Nkg-^1 ) Nkg-^1 = kg ms-^2 , kg-^1 = ms-^2 Therefore, gravitational field strength is sometimes called the acceleration due to gravity Up thrust on a Body in Fluid Consider a cylinder of height, l and cross- sectional area, A totally submerged in a fluid on density, \ud835\udf0c. such that its upper surface as at a depth, h from the surface of a fluid and its lower surface is at a depth, h 2 from the surface of the fluid. At the depth, h the pressure p is given by \ud835\udf0cgh F = P\u00d7 A \u00e0 F = \ud835\udf0cgh A At a particular depth the pressure on the sides the cylinder are the same and therefore the result horizontal force is zero. The pressure difference of P 2 \u2013 P 1 produces a resultant upward force or up thrust on the cylinder. Up thrust, u = F 2 \u2013 F 1 F = \ud835\udf0cgh A \u00e0 U = \ud835\udf0cgh 2 A \u2013 \ud835\udf0cgh, A =\ud835\udf0cgA (h 1 \u2013 h 2 ) But h 2 \u2013 h 1 = height of cylinder, e \u00e0 u = \ud835\udf0cgAl But Al = volume of cylinder = volume of fluid displaced, V \u00e0 u = \ud835\udf0cgv \u00e0 v = A (h 1 \u2013 h 2 ) = Al But \ud835\udf0cv = mass of fluid displaced, m \ud835\udf0c = )* \u00e0 u = mg But mg = weight of fluid displaced, W i.e. u = W i.e. Up trust = weight of fluid displaced. Archimedes Principle A body which is partly or totally submerged in a fluid experiences am up thrust which is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. Principle of Flotation A floating body displaces its own weight on the fluid which it floats. For a floating body: Up thrust = Weight of body i.e. Weight of fluid = weight of body displaced Frictional Forces The force that opposes or tends to oppose the relative motion between 2 bodies is called the force of friction. Frictional forces are presents in the relative motion between 2 solids, in liquids, in gases and solid object moving through liquids and gases. Whenever there is relative motion between bodies work is done against friction and the work done is converted into thermal energy. Frictional Forces in Solids Consider an object of weight, W resting on a rough horizontal surface, A gradually increasing force it applies to the object parallel to the surface. p = applied force w = weight R = normal reaction F = frictional force Initially as P is increased, the object does not move and is therefore in equilibrium which implies that F = P If the object remains in equilibrium as P increases, then the frictional force also increases. At a particular value for P the object just starts to move at this point the frictional forces is a maximum and is called the limiting frictional force. The object is said to be in limiting equilibrium. The frictional fore which acts while the object is still stationary is called static friction. When the object is in limiting equilibrium , the friction force is directly proportional to the normal reaction. F \u221d R F = R m \u2013 coefficient of friction In general F \u2264 mR When there is relative motion between the surfaces , the frictional force is called sliding or dynamic or kinetic friction. (The nature of the frictional force is at the points contact). The nature of the frictional force results from the forces of attraction between the points of contacts between the 2 surfaces while they rest on each other. Laws of Friction 1 st \u2013 The friction force between two surfaces opposes the relative motion or attempted motion between the surfaces. 2 nd \u2013 The frictional force is dependent of the area of contact between the surfaces. 3 rd \u2013 The limiting frictional force is directly proportional to the normal reaction F\u221d R, F = mR Viscous Forces Viscous/drag force is the frictional force in fluids. i.e. in liquids and gases. P R F W In liquids, the viscous force arises from the intermolecular forces of attraction between adjacent layers of liquid. Example: A liquid which flows through a channel is considered to flow in layers. The layer or contact with the channel is at rest. This layer exerts intermolecular forces of attraction on the layer adjacent to it and so on. The result is that the layer at the center of the channel flows with the greatest speed. In gases, the viscous force arises as a result of the interchange of molecules between adjacent layers of flow of gas. When an object moves through a fluid, the viscous drag force exerted on the object depends on: i. The shape of the object ii. The viscosity of the object iii. The velocity of the object. F \u221d V - laminar conditions F \u221d V ^2 \u2013 turbulent conditions Static Equilibrium Moments of a force or torque Definition: The moment of a force about an axis is the product of the force and the perpendicular distance of its lines action from the axis. Moment of force about axis = Force \u00d7 Perpendicular distance of force from axis T = F \u00d7 r Notes: \u00d8 Units: Nm \u00d8 A couple consists of two forces which are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction and which do not act along the same line so that they produce rotation. Torque of couple = (F \u00d7 AB) + (F \u00d7 BC) = F (AB + BC) = F \u00d7 AC = F \u00d7 perpendicular distance between the forces. V V V V F A B C F Principle of Moments For rigid body in equilibrium, the algebraic sum of the moments of the forces about any axis is zero. Conditions for Equilibrium The resultant force is any two mutually perpendicular directions is zero. The resultant torque about any axis is zero Triangle of Forces If 2 forces acting on a point can be represented in magnitude and direction b the sides of a triangle take in order, then the 3 forces would produce a resultant of zero. Note: The converse of this is true The rule can be extended to a polygon of forces. *The resultant of F, and F 2 is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to F 3 and therefore the resultant is zero.

If velocity increases, then the object is said to be accelerating and if the velocity decreases then the object is said to be decelerating. An object is said to be moving with uniform acceleration if the velocity change is constant per unit time. a = *-$. v = final velocity u = initial velocity t = time Displacement- Time (s.t) Graph The s.t graph shows how the displacement of an object from a particular position (the origin) varies with time. The gradient of the s.t graph gives the velocity of the object. If the velocity is constantly changing, then the gradient of the tangent at a point gives the velocity of the object at that point (i.e. instantaneous velocity). If the velocity is constant over a given time interval, then the gradient is constant, and the velocity maybe calculated by finding the gradient over the time interval. Positive or negative gradient indicates positive or negative velocity which indicates the direction of motion of the object. Positive or negative displacements indicates the position of the object relative to the origin. When v and s have the same sign, they move away from the origin. When v and s have different signs, they move towards the origin. From A velocity increased gently to B From B velocity increased uniformly to C From C the decrease velocity occurs to D From D to E the velocity is zero, the distance is S 1 From E to F velocity is negative and slowly increases. From F to G the velocity is negative, uniformly increases. From G to H, the displacement is negative, velocity is negative, and uniformly increasing. From H to I, the displacement is negative, velocity is negative and decreases gently. From I to J, the displacement is negative, velocity positive and slowly/gently increasing. From J to K, the displacement is negative, velocity decreasing becomes zero.

The gradient of the velocity time graph gives the acceleration of the object; a) If the acceleration of the object is constantly changing, then the acceleration at a point (i.e. instantaneous acceleration) is the gradient at the tangent of the point. b) If the acceleration of the object is uniform over a given time interval, then the gradient is constant and acceleration is determined by calculating the gradient over the time interval. The area under the velocity time graph in a given time interval gives the distance travelled by the object in that time. The negative and positive signs for velocity indicate the direction in which the object is travelling.

Projectiles Consider the motion of particle when projected in a uniform gravitational field in any direction. The following terms describe the projectile motion: The Trajectory- is the path described by the particle. The range- is the distance between the point of projection and the point where the trajectory meets any plane through the point of the projection. The angle of projection- is the angle between the direction of projection and the horizontal plane through the point of projection. Consider a particle projected in a uniform gravitational field without air resistance. The particle is projected with a velocity, u at an angle \u019f to the horizontal. At time, t the particle has a velocity, v and is at the angle \u221d to the horizontal. The vertical and horizontal displacements at this time are x and y respectively. In projectile motion, the vertical and horizontal motion are considered separately since the acceleration due to gravity acts vertically. The initial velocity, u is therefore resolved into its vertical and horizontal components. The horizontal components of velocity remain constant throughout motion. However, the vertical component of velocity is affected by g and therefore changes with time. The equations of motions can therefore be used when considered the vertical motion of the projectile.

The acceleration of the object therefore decreases (.F = ma), the velocity of the object still increases but now at a lower rate. As the velocity increases further, the drag force, F also g v U F W increases, and the FR decreases further. This continues until the resultant force; F = 0 and hence the acceleration = 0 .

The object reaches its maximum height and on return attains terminal velocity. Draw and explain the velocity time graph for the motion of the object.

A 1 = A 2 Distance up = Distance Down T 1 < T 2 Starter time up then come down Downward motion FR = W \u2013 F \u2013 U Upward Motion Initially velocity is maximum and hence the drag force, F is a maximum. The resultant force, FR is maximum. This force opposes the motion and therefore the velocity decreases. As the object moves upwards the velocity decreases and the drag force, F decreases and hence the magnitude of FR decreases (which implies that acceleration decreases) At Maximum Height Velocity = 0 Drag force, F = 0 Downward Motion As the velocity of the object increases from 0, the drag force, F also increases and the resultant force, FR decreases. This continues until the object reaches terminal velocity. Dynamics Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion Newton\u2019s First Law A body continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line (i.e. uniform velocity unless acted upon by a resultant force). Note: This law suggests that a body which is at rest requires a resultant force for motion and if a body is moving a resultant force is required to increase/ decrease the magnitude of the velocity or change the direction of the velocity. The inertia of a body is the resistance to change in motion and therefore Newton\u2019s First Law is sometimes called the law of inertia. A body of large mass requires a large force to change its motion and therefore the mass of a body is a measure of its inertia . Mass Weight Is the measure of the inertia of a body.

Definition The resultant force exerted on a body is defined as its rate of change of momentum. Newton\u2019s Third Law When object A exerts a force on B, object B exerts an equal and opposite force of an object A. Notes: The forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction and they act on different bodies.

Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum Consider an object A of mass, m and initial velocity, u colliding with an object B of mass, m 2 and initial velocity, u 2.

Classification of Collisions Inelastic Collisions \u2013 Are those in which kinetic energy is not conserved. The kinetic energy is usually is usually converted to heat or sound. A completely inelastic collision is one in which the base stick together after impact. The loss of kinetic energy is large but not complete. Elastic Collisions \u2013 are those in which kinetic energy is conserved example: gas molecules make elastic collisions with each other. Consider a perfectly elastic head on collision between 2 bodies A and B whose masses are m 1 and m 2 respectively and initial velocities u 1 and u 2 respectively.

However, it can be applied to smaller forces which act over a longer period. When an object undergoes a momentum change by an applied force. The applied force maybe large for a short time interval and still produces the same momentum change. Example: Jumping with knees bent reduce force Air- bag increases the time interval for impact therefore decreasing the force.

This means that the graphs for the cars will have the same shape and size. The areas for car A and car B are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign which means the impulse for both cars are equal in magnitude but opposite direction i.e. the momentum change for the cars are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction and hence the total momentum change for collision is zero i.e. momentum is conserved.

If the velocity changes then by definition the particle is accelerating.by Newton\u2019s 2nd law (F = ma) there must also be a resultant force which is in the direction of the acceleration. The magnitude of the velocity is unchanged, and the acceleration and force must be perpendicular to the travel at any instant. The accelerated is directed towards the center of the circular path and is called the centripetal acceleration. The resultant force is in the same direction and is called the centripetal force.

The frictional force however has a maximum value (\u019e\ud835\udc45).

Notes: \u00d8 Gravitational forces are always forces of attraction \u00d8 Gravitational forces are mostly negliable unless atleast one very massive body is involved. Example: the earth \u00d8 The direction of the gravitational field at a point is the direction of the force exerted on a mass at that point. Gravitational Field Strength, g The gravitational field strength at a point in gravitational field is the force exerted per unit mass at that point. g = i/ Notes: \u00d8 Units: Nkg- 1 \u00d8 g is a vector quantity whose direction is the same as that of the force exerted. \u00d8 From Newton\u2019s second law (a = )/) and therefore the gravitational force exerted at a mass at a point in the gravitational field produces an acceleration which is numerically equal to the gravitational field strength and hence g is sometimes called the acceleration due to gravity. Furthermore, the units are the same for gravitational field strength and acceleration.

A random error is said to have occurred. These result in a scatter of readings about a mean value and have an equal chance of being positive or negative. Random errors may be caused by a) Inability of the observer to repeat a procedure exactly. Example 1: Variation in reaction time in starting and stopping a stopwatch. Example 2: Interpretation of the actually position of the pointer on the scale. b) Sensitivity of the measuring instrument Example 1: The mechanics of the moving coil meter may cause the pointer to settle in different positions even though the same value is being measured. c) A particular measurement not being reproducible. Example 1: When measuring how temperature falls with time for a particular substance, a value missed cannot be retrieved even though the experiment is repeated. Random errors may be revealed by repeating observations of a particular quantity. If an average is then calculated for a measurement, then the random error may be reduced. Systematic Error A systematic error changes all measurements of a particular quantity equally. Systematic errors result in all the readings taken being faulty in one direction. Systematic errors may be caused by a) An instrument having a zero error Example: A disconnected ammeter which reads 0.2 A will result in all measurements being 0.2 A too large. Example 2: A micrometer screw gauge which is not at zero when it is fully closed. Incorrect calibration of an instrument. Example: A liquid in glass thermometer which does not have 100 equal divisions between 0 and 100. The observer persistently carrying out the wrong reaction.
